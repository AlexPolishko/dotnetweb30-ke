# Acceptance testing, Acceptance Test Driven Development \(ATDD\)

{% hint style="success" %}
**Acceptance testâ€“driven development** \(**ATDD**\) is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers.
{% endhint %}

ATDD is closely related to test-driven development \(TDD\). It differs by the emphasis on developer-tester-business customer collaboration. ATDD encompasses acceptance testing, but highlights writing acceptance tests before developers begin coding.

### Test format

Acceptance tests usually follow this form:

* **Given \(setup\)** - A specified state of a system
* **When \(trigger\)** - An action or event occurs
* **Then \(verification\)** - The state of the system has changed or an output has been produced

Also, it is possible to add Statements that start with **AND** in any of the sections below \(Given, When, Then\).

 For the example requirement, the steps could be listed as:

```text
Given Book that has not been checked out
And User who is registered on the system
When User checks out a book
Then Book is marked as checked out
```

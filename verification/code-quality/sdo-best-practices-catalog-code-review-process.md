# SDO Best Practices Catalog - Code Review Process

### Benefits

* The strongly defined code review process allows to avoid functional and non-functional defects appearing, prevents anti-patterns and bad practices in the code, increases maintenance of the product, forces code conventions across the team, and lets the team members share knowledge between each other.
* The code review increases responsibility for the code quality by each team member.
* Using a code review tool simplifies the code review, when it is needed to involve several reviewers, enables involvement of an observer role, and decouples an author and a reviewer, as the author is not required to wait for the reviewer to start a review. In addition, the reviewer is able to review just updated changes in comparison to failed review changes that simplifies and speeds up the review process.

### Indicators of Successful Process

* The code review procedure is defined and documented
* Code review checklist is used
* Code is reviewed against requirements \(code and project conventions, specified architecture, functional and non-functional requirements, security guidelines\)
* Code review is used as learning and knowledge sharing instrument and share typical findings among team members
* Code review workflow is using best practices for selected tool
* Code review is automated \(specialized review tools are used\)
* All changes are reviewed and validated
* Consistent code conventions are enforced through all product parts or modules
*  Code review process roles are assigned: referee, author, reviewer. One person cannot have more than one role. 
* Code review is done in small portions: up to 400 lines per review, up to 2 hours per day for reviewer and collect metrics to enforce that practice
* A wiki of project best practices are up to date and those practices are enforced on review
* Reviews are optimized:
* * * Drop trivial changes review \(e. g. some autogenerated files, etc.\)
    * Setup focused review sessions guided by author to speedup \(author comments changes and provides context for made decisions\)
    * Involve only necessary reviewers
    * Author critically reviews own code before requesting a code review
    * Review statistics is collected and used to optimize review process
*  Process ensures that identified code review defects or action items are fixed
* Feedback cycles are reduced by introducing relevant, intelligent comments
* Code review results are reviewed and approved by project leadership team
* Code review items are closed along with the story and are part of acceptance criteria

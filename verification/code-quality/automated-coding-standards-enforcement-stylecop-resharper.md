# Automated coding standards enforcement \(StyleCop, Resharper\)

**StyleCop** is an open-source static code analysis tool from Microsoft that checks C\# code for conformance to StyleCop's recommended coding styles and a subset of Microsoft's .NET Framework Design Guidelines. The rules are classified into the following categories:

* Documentation
* Layout
* Maintainability
* Naming
* Ordering
* Readability
* Spacing

StyleCop is available in two primary forms:

1. The StyleCop Visual Studio extension, which allows StyleCop analysis to be run on any file, project, or solution in Visual Studio without modifying the source code.
2. The StyleCop.MSBuild NuGet package, which allows StyleCop analysis to be added to any .NET 4.0+ project without installing anything else on the system.

**ReSharper** is a popular developer productivity extension for Microsoft Visual Studio. It automates most of what can be automated in coding routines. It **finds compiler errors, runtime errors, redundancies, and code smells** right as you type, suggesting intelligent corrections for them.

ReSharper **helps to explore code** by visualizing the structure of files, type and style hierarchies, call and value chains, project dependencies. It allows to instantly traverse the entire solution and jump right to the exact file and line that you are looking for, decompiling library code if necessary.

Dozens of solution-wide refactorings are available to help **safely change the code base**. Code formatting and cleanup features allow to get rid of unused code and help the entire team to **ensure compliance to coding standards**.

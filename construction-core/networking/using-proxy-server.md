# Using proxy server

In computer networks, a **proxy server** is a server \(a computer system or an application\) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource available from a different server and the proxy server evaluates the request as a way to simplify and control its complexity. Proxies were invented to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems.

A proxy server may reside on the user's local computer, or at any point between the user's computer and destination servers on the Internet.

* A proxy server that passes unmodified requests and responses is usually called a gateway or sometimes a tunneling proxy.
* A forward proxy is an Internet-facing proxy used to retrieve data from a wide range of sources \(in most cases anywhere on the Internet\).
* A reverse proxy is usually an internal-facing proxy used as a front-end to control and protect access to a server on a private network. A reverse proxy commonly also performs tasks such as load-balancing, authentication, decryption or caching.

Uses for:

* Content-control software
* Filtering of encrypted data
* Bypassing filters and censorship
* Logging and eavesdropping
* Accessing services anonymously
* Security
* Cross-domain resources
* To control internet usage of employees and children
* Get access to blocked resources

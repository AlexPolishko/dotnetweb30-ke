# Kanban

{% hint style="success" %}
**Kanban** is a technique for managing a software development process in a highly efficient way. Kanban underpins Toyota's "just-in-time" \(JIT\) production system. Although producing software is a creative activity and therefore different to mass-producing cars, the underlying mechanism for managing the production line can still be applied.

### Three rules of Kanban

* Kan – visualize, Ban – board
* WIP \(Work In Progress\) limiting
* Maximizing efficiency/flow \(minimizing lean time - time from the begging of task to the end\)

# Scrum vs Kanban: applicability

_Kanban_ and _scrum_ are frameworks that help teams adhere to agile principles and get stuff done.

**Agile** is a structured and iterative approach to project management and product development. It recognizes the volatility of product development, and provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change without going off the rails.

**Kanban** is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency\(or flow\). Kanban teams focus on reducing the time it takes to take a project\(or user story\) from start to finish. They do this by using a kanban board and continuously improving their flow of work. 

|  | **Scrum** | **Kanban** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cadence | Regular fixed length sprints \(ie, 2 weeks\) | Continuous flow |
| Release methodology | At the end of each sprint | Continuous delivery |
| Roles | Product owner, scrum master, development team | No required roles |
| Key metrics | Velocity | Lead time, cycle time, WIP |
| Change philosophy | Teams should not make changes during the sprint. | Change can happen at any time |

### **When to use Kanban**

* Scrum doesn’t work well with your team \(fail with sprint delivery\)
* Priorities can’t be frozen
* No general picture of progress
* Working overtime

#### **Otherwise, use Scrum!**

# Scope Concept

{% hint style="success" %}
**Scope** involves getting information required to start a project, and the features the product would have that would meet its stakeholders requirements.
{% endhint %}

The term `scope` has two distinct uses:

* `Project Scope`: the work that needs to be accomplished to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions
* `Product Scope`: the features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result

{% hint style="info" %}
Project Scope is more work-oriented \(the hows\), while Product Scope is more oriented toward functional requirements \(the whats\).
{% endhint %}

If requirements aren't completely defined and described and if there is no effective change control in a project, scope or requirement creep may ensue.

**Scope Management** is the listing of the items to be produced or tasks to be done to the required quantity, quality and variety, in the time and with the resources available and agreed upon, and the modification of those variable constraints by dynamic flexible juggling in the event of changed circumstance called as Scope creep.

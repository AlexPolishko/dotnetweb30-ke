# Fundamental concepts: revisions, working copy, repository, branch, baseline, trunk

  
A component of software configuration management, version control, also known as **revision control** or source control, is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.

**Revision** \(also version\): version is any change in form. 

The **repository** is where files' current and historical data are stored, often on a server. Sometimes also called a depot.

**Branch.** A set of files under version control may be **branched** or **forked** at a point in time so that, from that time forward, two copies of those files may develop at different speeds or in different ways independently of each other.

**Baseline** **\(tag, label\) –** an approved revision of a document or source file from which subsequent changes can be made \(commit in git\).

**Trunk** **–** the  unique line of development that is not a branch \(sometimes also called Baseline, Mainline or Master\). In the trunk-based development model, all developers work on a single branch with open access to it. Often it’s simply the master branch. They commit code to it and run it.

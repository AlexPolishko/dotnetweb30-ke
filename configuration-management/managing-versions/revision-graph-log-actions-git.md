# Revision graph/log actions \(Git\)

Some tools \(like TortoiseGit, GitExtencions\) provide an ability to know where branches and tags were taken from the point, and the ideal way to view this sort of information is as a graph or tree structure. **Revision graph** is a graph that shows branches and merges.

After you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a repository with an existing commit history, youâ€™ll probably want to look back to see what has happened. The most basic and powerful tool to do this is the **git log** command.

# Authorization with roles

When an identity is created it may belong to one or more roles. For example, Tracy may belong to the Administrator and User roles whilst Scott may only belong to the User role.

### Adding role checks <a id="adding-role-checks"></a>

Role-based authorization checks are declarativeâ€”the developer embeds them within their code, against a controller or an action within a controller, specifying roles which the current user must be a member of to access the requested resource.

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "HRManager,Finance")]
public class SalaryController : Controller
{
}
```

This controller would be only accessible by users who are members of the `HRManager` role or the `Finance` role.

If you apply multiple attributes then an accessing user must be a member of all the roles specified:

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "PowerUser")]
[Authorize(Roles = "ControlPanelUser")]
public class ControlPanelController : Controller
{
}
```

You can also lock down a controller but allow anonymous, unauthenticated access to individual actions:

```csharp
[Authorize]
public class ControlPanelController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult SetTime()
    {
    }

    [AllowAnonymous]
    public ActionResult Login()
    {
    }
}
```

### Policy based role checks <a id="policy-based-role-checks"></a>

Role requirements can also be expressed using the new Policy syntax, where a developer registers a policy at startup as part of the Authorization service configuration. This normally occurs in `ConfigureServices()` in your _Startup.cs_ file.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc();

    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("RequireAdministratorRole",
             policy => policy.RequireRole("Administrator"));
    });
}
```

Policies are applied using the `Policy` property on the `AuthorizeAttribute` attribute:

```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdministratorRole")]
public IActionResult Shutdown()
{
    return View();
}
```

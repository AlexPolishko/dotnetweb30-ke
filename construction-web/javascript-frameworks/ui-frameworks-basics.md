# UI frameworks basics:

### Bootstrap basics

 **Bootstrap** is a [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source) [CSS framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework) directed at responsive, mobile-first [front-end web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development). It contains [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)- and \(optionally\) [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)-based design templates for [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design#Typography), [forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_%28HTML%29), [buttons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_%28computing%29#HTML), [navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_navigation#Local_website_navigation) and other interface components.

Bootstrap is a web framework that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages \(as opposed to [web apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Apps)\). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all [HTML elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element). The end result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser). In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.

Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components in the form of [jQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery) plugins. They provide additional user interface elements such as [dialog boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_box), [tooltips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooltip), and carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example an auto-complete function for input fields.

### Material UI basics

 [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) framework comprises React components for implementing Googleâ€™s Material design.This CSS framework is robust and reliable. It comes with detailed documentation, which will help you to set up your project from the scratch and also with the processes that follow.

Material-UI components work without any additional setup, and don't pollute the global scope.

```text
  import React from 'react';
  import Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';

  const App = () => (
    <Button variant="contained" color="primary">
      Hello World
    </Button>
  );
```

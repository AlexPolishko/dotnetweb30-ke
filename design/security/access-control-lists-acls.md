# Access Control Lists \(ACLs\)

{% hint style="success" %}
An **access-control list \(ACL\)**, with respect to a computer file system, is a list of permissions attached to an object. An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects.
{% endhint %}

Each entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation. For instance, if a file object has an ACL that contains _\(Alice: read,write; Bob: read\)_, this would give Alice permission to read and write the file and Bob to only read it.

#### Implementations

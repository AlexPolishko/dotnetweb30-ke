# Relational terminology: Attributes

{% hint style="success" %}
Your system will need to keep track of certain facts about each entity. These facts are referred to as the entity's **attributes**.
{% endhint %}

If your system includes Customer entities, for example, you'll probably want to know the names and addresses of the customers and perhaps the businesses they're in.

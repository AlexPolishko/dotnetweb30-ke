# Polymorphism

{% hint style="success" %}
**Polymorphism** is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types.
{% endhint %}

#### The most commonly recognized major classes of polymorphism are:

1. [Ad hoc polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism): defines a common interface for an arbitrary set of individually specified types \(function overloading or operator overloading\).
2. [Parametric polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism): when one or more types are not specified by name but by abstract symbols that can represent any type \(templates in C++ and D, generics in C\# and Java\).
3. [Subtyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping) \(also called subtype polymorphism or inclusion polymorphism\): when a name denotes instances of many different classes related by some common superclass. \(you can pass an object to a method that takes more generic type â€“ [Liskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)\)
